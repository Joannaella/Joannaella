ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joanna

About Me
- I'm a Biomedical Engineering student fascinated by the world of data and its never-ending stories waiting to be told. 
I see in data not only numbers and facts but also hidden narratives that I love to uncover and transform into visual stories. 
My approach to data analysis is based on blending intuitive understanding with technical knowledge.

ðŸ‘€ Technical Skills
- Programming Languages: Python, C++
- Databases: SQL
- Tools: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Microsoft Excel
